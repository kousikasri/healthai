The Healthcare Assistant Chatbot is an AI-driven application designed to assist users in obtaining 
preliminary healthcare information. With the growing demand for digital healthcare solutions, this 
chatbot provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to address common medical inquiries 
related to symptoms, medication, and appointment scheduling. 
 
The system is developed using Python, with Streamlit as the front-end framework for an intuitive 
user experience. The chatbot leverages DistilGPT2, a transformer-based language model, to generate 
intelligent responses. Additionally, predefined rule-based logic is integrated to handle critical 
healthcare-related queries that require specific guidance. 
 
The primary objective of the chatbot is to serve as an initial point of assistance, offering guidance 
while encouraging users to consult professional healthcare providers for accurate diagnoses and 
treatments. The system ensures accessibility and responsiveness while maintaining ethical 
considerations regarding medical information.
